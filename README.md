# Image Downloader
 This project is a Python-based web application that allows users to download a specified number of images based on a keyword search. Using the search engine, it fetches relevant images and provides them in a downloadable ZIP format. The web interface is user-friendly, where users can input a search keyword and the desired number of images, and the server responds by fetching the images and generating a downloadable ZIP file.
